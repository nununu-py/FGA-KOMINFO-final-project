# FGA-KOMINFO-final-project
Final project from fresh graduate academy - data science bootcamp. KOMINFO x Binar Academy.

Project 1 description :
On project 1 we were assigned to do an analysis of covid-19 data in Indonesia using google bigquery and then visualizing our findings
in the form of a dashboard using google looker tools. You can see the results of the dashboard in the file "project1_Dashboard Covid-19.png"

Project 2 decription :
On project 2 we were assigned to predict customer churn in the telecommunications sector. The data used is not too much, 
it only consists of around 4250 data with a total of 20 columns. On this project we use a lot of statistical analysis methods 
including univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and perform other calculations such as weight of evidence, information value, mutual information 
and others to select the best features for model calculations. In addition, we also apply the hyper parameter tuning method to each machine learning model 
to find the model with the best performance for making predictions. You can see the results of the model predictions in the file "project2_Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb".
